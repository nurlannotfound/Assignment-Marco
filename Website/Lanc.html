    <h1>Lancaster University Leipzig</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our university! 
        Lancaster UniversityÂ´s operation in Leipzig has been approved by the Saxon State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts. The campus is located in the heart of the City of Leipzig and welcomes German, EU and international students. </p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>In 1947 a public meeting in Lancaster endorsed a proposal that a university might be established in the city.

        The idea lay dormant until Lancashire County Council revived it in early 1961. The Council created a Promotion Committee for a University in North-West Lancashire. Lord Derby was the chair of the committee. The Promotion Committee presented a proposal to the University Grants Committee for Lancaster.
        
        From the day it opened its doors, the new institution had full authority to manage its affairs within the terms of its Royal Charter and Statutes.
        
        We dedicate these pages to the history of Lancaster University. We have charted the evolution and construction of the campus. Beginning as a greenfield site and early home in the city, and provided a picture of what it was like to study here during the "swinging sixties" and the early 1970s.</p>
